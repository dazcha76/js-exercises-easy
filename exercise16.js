// Easy Challenge: Arith Geo

// Create a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the string "Arithmetic" if the sequence follows an arithmetic pattern, return "Geometric" if it follows a geometric pattern. If the sequence doesn't follow either pattern return -1. An arithmetic sequence is one where the difference between each of the numbers is consistent, where as in a geometric sequence, each term after the first is multiplied by some constant or common ratio.
// Arithmetic example: [2, 4, 6, 8]
// Geometric example: [2, 6, 18, 54].
// Negative numbers may be entered as parameters, 0 will not be entered, and no array will contain all the same elements.

// Sample Test Cases
// Input:5,10,15
// Output:"Arithmetic"

// Input:2,4,16,24
// Output:-1
